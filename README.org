#+TITLE: aosp-meson

This is a project that aims to make the Android Open Source Project easily buildable without bringing in 400 gigabytes of dependencies and prebuilt binaries.

* Building
Currently only a few libraries are buildable at the moment.
You need to have a relatively modern C/C++ compiler installed, such as Clang 19 or GCC 14.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
meson setup build
ninja -C build
#+END_SRC

* TODO
- [ ] ART java runtime
- [ ] fastboot
- [ ] adb
